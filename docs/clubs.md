# Clubs

Clubs are the beating heart of Gaff, your brand, your legacy. A club isn’t just a roster screen, it’s a sovereign on-chain organization with assets, fans, and a timeline of glory you literally own.

### What a Club _Is_

- **A legal-ish bundle of rights (on-chain):** your crest, kit set, and roster (Player NFTs) live under your club identity.
- **A performance machine:** formations, tactics, training plans, and match history shape results and reputation.
- **An economy:** prize money, transfer revenue, shop spend, academy mints, and secondary royalties flow through your club treasury.
- **A social magnet:** chat threads, rivalries, and community-led events build intangible value, referrals, audience, sponsors (roadmap).

#### 2) Roster & Depth Chart

- **Instructions**: pressing, width, tempo, game plan, defensive style, line height, marking, offside trap.
- **Sub plans**: scheduled minute windows, conditional subs (fatigue/injury), and safe handling of empty slots (no crashes).
- **Analytics**: shot map (roadmap), expected goals-lite, player ratings trend, rolling form.

#### 4) Training & Development

- **Drills** with diminishing returns and fatigue costs (finishing, first touch, pace, vision, press resistance, aerials, defensive shape).
- **Weekly plans** that auto-respect match days.
- **Shop boosts** (energy, focus, rehab, morale) with anti-farm caps.

#### 5) Academy Pipeline

  - **Creator fee:** 5% (capped at **1 BNB**) paid at conclusion (tournaments & leagues).
  - **Join/Leave window**: open until `teamCount` fills, then the contract **locks,** no new joins/leaves.
