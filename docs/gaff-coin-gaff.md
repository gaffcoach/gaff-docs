# Gaff Coin (GAFF)

**Status:** _Not launched. No sale is live. No token is available to purchase today._\
**Chain:** Launching on **BNB Smart Chain (BSC)** first, designed for **multi-chain**.\
**Ticker:** **GAFF**\
**Role:** The future coordination layer for the entire Gaff economy, governance, utility, rewards, and alignment.

### Why GAFF exists

Gaff already works without a token, tournaments, leagues, marketplace, academy, training, referrals. GAFF turns that working machine into a **player-owned economy**:

- **Align incentives:** When managers host events, scout prospects, train players, trade, moderate communities, or build tools, the value they create should compound back to them.
- **Govern credibly:** Tournament rules, fee switches, emissions, and treasury spend should be **on-chain votes**, not admin toggles.
- **Scale cross-ecosystem:** A chain-agnostic currency lets Gaff bridge partners, exchanges, and fans globally.

### Core utilities (day-1 and beyond)

| Area                          | Utility (using GAFF)                                                                                  | Notes                                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Governance (DAO)**          | Vote on protocol parameters, fee switches, treasury spend, new formats                                | Token-weighted with anti-whale guardrails (e.g., caps, quorum, delegated voting) |
| **Hosting & creation**        | Pay or bond GAFF to create **tournaments/leagues,** get partial rebate when event completes cleanly   | Aligns creators with fair play & completion                                      |
| **Fees & discounts**          | Pay marketplace fees, academy mints, training boosts in GAFF for **discounts**                        | Fee switch set by DAO, stablecoin also accepted                                  |
| **Rewards & incentives**      | Structured emissions to **top divisions, verified creators, referees/mods, analytics builders**       | KPI-gated, no idle inflation                                                     |
| **Staking & slashing**        | Stake GAFF to access **creator tiers**, ref roles, or anti-sybil **identity boosts,** slash for fraud | Proof-of-intent to keep the ecosystem clean                                      |
| **Gas abstraction**           | Pay gas in GAFF where possible, relayers settle chain gas under the hood                              | UX: “Pay with GAFF” toggle                                                       |
| **Season passes & cosmetics** | Premium badges, chat flair, custom kit layers                                                         | Purely cosmetic, no pay-to-win                                                   |
| **Treasury alignment**        | Buybacks/burns or liquidity programs (if DAO approves)                                                | _Policy subject to vote_                                                         |

> **FOMO fuel, not fluff:** GAFF is the _work token_ that powers creation, moderation, and growth. The more football played on-chain, the more GAFF is _used,_ not just held.

### Token mechanics: sources & sinks

**Demand drivers (sinks)**

- Tournament/league **creation bonds** (refundable on clean completion, partial burn on fraud/rage-quit)
- **Marketplace fees** (reduced when paid in GAFF, DAO can route % to burn/treasury/creators)
- **Academy graduation mints** (GAFF or stable, GAFF gets discount)
- **Training boosts & rehab packs** (anti-farm caps, GAFF optional with discount)
- **Premium tooling** (advanced analytics APIs, data exports, automation credits)

**Distribution (sources)** _(framework, final numbers TBD)_

- **Play incentives** (skill-weighted, anti-farm)
- **Creator rewards** (event completion + integrity score)
- **Referee/mod bounties** (dispute resolution, anti-sybil)
- **Ecosystem grants** (analytics dashboards, scouting tools, language communities)
- **Liquidity programs** (time-bound, declining schedule)

---

### Governance (GAFF → Gaff DAO)

**What the DAO can control (illustrative):**

- Tournament defaults: **payout formats** (Hardline/Broad), **tie-break rules**, **max frequency** ranges
- **Fee switches:** marketplace %, creation bond %, referral %
- **Emissions:** total per-season emissions, KPI gate (active users, retention, fraud score)
- **Treasury policy:** buybacks/burn, grants, market making partners
- **Chain expansion:** deploy/bridge to additional L1s, L2s and sidechains
- **Compliance guardrails:** sanctioned regions, responsible-play toggles

**Voting scaffolding:**

- Snapshot-style off-chain signaling → on-chain executor _(Timelock + multisig guardian in early phases)_
- **Delegated voting** for managers who prefer to focus on play
- **Quorum & caps** to reduce whale capture, **“one-club-one-vote” pilots** for certain sporting rules

---

### Multi-chain from day one

- **Home base:** **BSC** for low fees and massive retail reach
- **Bridging:** Canonical bridge (DAO-approved), with **wrapped GAFF** on additional chains
- **State separation:** Core gameplay contracts per chain, **shared identity & reputation** (soul-bound attestation)
- **Treasury management:** Multi-sig per chain + cross-chain governor

> _Why it matters:_ Let communities play where they are, BSC, then L1s/L2s/sidechains, while keeping GAFF the common economic thread.

### Economic design principles

1. **Utility first.** Every sink should unlock a concrete advantage in _experience_ (not raw power).
2. **Demand is earned.** Emissions are **KPI-based** (active clubs, completion rate, fraud index).
3. **No death spirals.** Discounts cap at rational levels; fees are adjustable by vote.
4. **Fair creator upside.** Event creators earn a **5% fee (capped at 1 BNB)** at conclusion, DAO can route a slice in GAFF for alignment.
5. **Anti-farm by design.** Identity heuristics, slashing, and caps on repetitive actions.
6. **Clarity > hype.** Transparent dashboards for fee flows, emissions, and treasury.

### Example policy knobs (DAO-tunable)

| Knob                           | Current / Default (proposed)    | Range          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Creator fee                    | **5% (capped at 1 BNB)**        | 0–5%           |
| Marketplace fee (GAFF pay)     | **1.5%**                        | 0–2%           |
| Marketplace fee (non-GAFF pay) | **2.0%**                        | 1–3%           |
| Tournament creation bond       | **Variable (size × frequency)** | 0–X            |
| Academy mint discount (GAFF)   | **10–20%**                      | 0–30%          |
| Emissions per season           | **DAO-set**                     | KPI-gated      |
| Burn switch                    | **Off by default**              | On/Off by vote |

> These are starting points for governance, **not final.**

### Frequently asked (ahead of launch)

**When token?**\
After utility integration is ready (fees, bonds, staking), and governance scaffolding is audited. We’re building **function first, token second**.

**Airdrop/wL?**\
Any distribution will reward **real participation**: completed events, fair-play record, verified referrals, tool building. Details will be shared **before** any launch.

**How to prepare?**\
Play tournaments/leagues, host clean events, build tools, help moderate. That’s the kind of activity we want to enshrine.
