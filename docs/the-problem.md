# The Problem

### 2.1 Closed worlds, trapped value

Traditional football managers amass millions of users, but when you “win,” nothing leaves the database. Players, squads, and grind cannot be monetized or used elsewhere.

### 2.2 In-game coin ≠ real value

Web2 “currencies” are just _permissions_ inside a private server. You can’t legally own them, transfer them on your terms, or realize any residual value from years of play. When a game deprecates a mode, or sunsets entirely, everything goes to zero for the player.

### 2.3 Cosmetic ownership, zero portability

You may _name_ a player or _customize_ a kit, but that asset cannot move, be sold, or be verified outside the publisher’s UI. Your time and taste create value you can’t capture.

### 2.4 Economies engineered for sink, not surplus

Web2 economies are designed to **absorb** value (bundles, season passes, loot boxes) and rarely **return** value. “Grind loops” inflate playtime while suppressing player agency over outcomes.

### 2.5 No secondary markets for skill

Scouting eyes, training discipline, tactical nuance, these are _real_ skills. In Web2 they produce _non-transferable progress_. You cannot list a developed prospect, loan a backup, or price your edge in an open market.

### 2.6 Fragile progression: the reset problem

Meta patches, roster resets, and new editions wipe your advantage. Years of mastery are routinely “rebalanced” away. The publisher captures continuity, the player loses it.

### 2.7 Tournament liquidity is artificial

Joining or running competitions relies on centralized admins, manual bracket edits, and arbitrary deadlines. Entries aren’t escrowed on join, forfeits and disputes turn social.

### 2.8 UX is great, until you want rights

Web2 has polished interfaces, but the moment you want **property rights** (sell a player, loan a prospect, port progress), the UX dead-ends. Convenience without ownership is a velvet rope.

### 2.9 Creator upside is one-sided

Communities organize contents, and tools that grow the ecosystem, yet there’s no native way to share upside. Web2 platforms capture network effects, communities get likes.
