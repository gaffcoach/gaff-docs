# Vision

### 1.1 One-line North Star

**Gaff will be the global on-chain soccer economy,** where digital clubs, players, and competitions function like real assets: owned, tradable, composable, and provably fair.

---

### 1.2 What that world looks like

#### A. Clubs without borders

- Anyone can **found a club**, set identity (crest, kits, philosophy), and **compound skill into equity**: scouting, training, tactics → appreciating player NFTs and tournament revenue.
- **Dynasties** become possible: multi-season continuity, historic rivalries, and fan-priced sponsorships that persist across years and formats.

#### B. Talent markets that mirror the real game

- **Global scouting**: managers surface prospects from academy pools, form streaks, or underpriced attributes.
- **Player mobility**: NFTs are **developed, loaned, and transferred** with transparent terms (loan fees, buy clauses, revenue shares).
- **On-chain provenance** tracks every transformation: training history, injuries, minutes, rating arcs.

#### C. Competitions that run themselves

- **Smart contract tournaments** lock entries, schedule **simultaneous rounds**, auto-advance brackets, and **pay out instantly**.
- Tie breakers, awards, and histories are **deterministic and auditable,** trust is designed, not requested.

#### D. An ecosystem big enough for everyone

- **Leagues, brands, and media** onboard through white-label tools and revenue shares.
- Communities create **third-party analytics, trading terminals, and scouting overlays** against open data and sockets, earning via affiliate & referral rails.
- The result is **tens of millions of managers** playing, building, and transacting in a single liquid graph.

### 1.3 Pillars that make it inevitable

1. **Ownership by default**\
   Everything meaningful is an asset: players, tickets, revenue shares, collectibles. If it has value, it’s yours, portable and provable.
2. **Fairness you can verify**\
   Format separation (Knockout vs Mixed), simultaneous rounds, unified tie-break rules for **both UI and payouts**. No jank, no “admin overrides.”
3. **Surplus over sinks**\
   Training, academy, and scouting **create saleable surplus**. The shop is transparent and capped. Your discipline is worth money, not just screen time.
4. **Open by design**\
   APIs, event sockets, and marketplace standards let anyone build dashboards, bots, and tools. More builders → more liquidity → more value for everyone.
5. **UX without compromise**\
   Gasless for day to day, hard settlement underneath. Web2 polish with Web3 rights, **no velvet rope** when you want to sell, loan, or withdraw.

### 1.4 The flywheel

**Better Sim → Better Assets → Deeper Liquidity → Bigger Payouts → More Managers → More Data → Better Sim.**

- Higher fidelity simulation and training loops increase **player differentiation**.
- Differentiation drives **price discovery** and trading volume.
- Liquidity funds **larger prize pools** and sponsorships.
- Bigger prizes attract **more managers and brands**, creating more event data.
- More data improves the sim and scouting signals, **and the cycle accelerates**.

### 1.5 What success looks like (North-star metrics)

- **Users**: 10M+ managers, 30 day retention > **35%** for active clubs.
- **Economy**: Player NFT GMV $**1B+,** loan markets > **15%** of volume, average time to sale < **72h**.
- **Competition**: > **500k** monthly tournaments, > **95%** automated completion (no admin touch).
- **Fairness & trust**: 100% of **payouts & awards** verifiable on-chain, < **0.5%** dispute rate.
- **Ecosystem**: 1,000+ active third-party apps/tools, top 500 earners making **meaningful income** from overlays, leagues, or referrals.
