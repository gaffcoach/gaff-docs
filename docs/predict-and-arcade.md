# Predict & Arcade

Skill, instinct, momentum — rewarded daily.

Predict & Arcade is where attention turns into advantage. It’s Gaff’s always-on engagement layer: fast, fair, non-staking prediction challenges and premium arcade games that reward knowledge, timing, and consistency — not reckless risk.

This isn’t gambling.\
It’s **play-to-participate**, **predict-to-earn**, and **daily-skill compounding** — engineered to keep users active, competitive, and emotionally invested every single day.

### What Predict Is

Predict is Gaff’s intelligence market — a place where football insight, form reading, and instinct are converted into in-game rewards.

Every contest is:

- Free to enter (no staking)
- Time-boxed (real deadlines, real pressure)
- Outcome-based (performance decides rewards)

You don’t bet money.\
You **stake your understanding of the game**.

#### Predict Loop

1. Contests open (matches, leagues, tournaments, derbies).
2. Users submit predictions before kickoff.
3. Results resolve automatically from match outcomes.
4. Rewards are distributed based on accuracy, rarity, and contest weight.
5. Top performers rise, gain reputation, and unlock better opportunities.

Predict creates _daily reasons to return_, _social competition_, and _prestige for being consistently right_.

### Predict Contest Types

- **Match Outcomes** – Win / Draw / Loss
- **Scoreline Precision** – Exact or near-miss scoring
- **Multi-Match Slips** – Combined predictions with escalating rewards
- **Featured Contests** – Finals, derbies, high-impact matches (auto-pinned)
- **Community Challenges** (roadmap) – Sponsored or creator-hosted pools

Each contest carries a **fixture weight** (league importance, tournament stage, rivalry intensity), so predicting a Champions League final _matters more_ than a friendly — and feels like it.
