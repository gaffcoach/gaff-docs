# Introduction to Gaff

**Gaff** is the first crypto-native soccer management platform where users **own** everything they build, clubs, players, tactics, trophies and can trade or monetize their success. We’re merging the global obsession of soccer management with real digital property rights and on-chain competition.

- **Why now:** Web2 soccer managers have tens of millions of players, yet every hour of progression is trapped on centralized servers. Gaff turns that time into **assets**: your squad is an interoperable **NFT roster**, your wins are **on-chain**, and your reputation is **portable**.
- **What’s new:** First of its kind **crypto soccer manager** with fully on-chain tournaments, composable **NFT player markets**, and a provably fair **match engine**.
- **Why it matters:** Players don’t just “grind and forget”, they build **equity**. Clubs can be sold, talent can be scouted and flipped, and managers can win real prizes via decentralized tournaments.

The first platform to convert the world’s favorite management loop into a **real economy** where winners keep the upside. Your club, your players, your NFTs. Trade. Host leagues. Run tournaments. Make history.
